# 2DDungeon by Dobesch Csongor

This was a school project that i had to make during my 3rd year of high school
1. The goal of the project:
- Create a unique application that has both a graphic and a console side.
- I had to came up with the idea for the project.
- I had 2 months to deliver the final version.

2. About the project
- The game is a full custom dungeon game with its own engine.
- The game has random map generation for the dungeons.
- The game has an online scorebord wich uses Google cloud SQL hosting (currently down becouse of non use).

3. My contribution
- I did everything in the project except the server hosting, for that i used google cloud for.

4. The project successes
- I have sucessfully finished the project before the deadline and i was quite happy with how it turned out.
